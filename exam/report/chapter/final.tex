\chapter{Final considerations}
The creation of a deception component was possible going through different phases.
\\
At the beginning i've had to understand the service that was chosen to be duplicated with random data, after i've had to understand how create a Dockerfile to create it and make configuration possible and, at the end, the main point of all is how to generate credible data to insert into it.
\\\\
This was the main task, because some LLM runned locally performed not so good for what i was aimning to do. So to solve that i gave a quick look at the possibility to define a grammar in llama-cpp-python, to get a precise output. Unfortunately even doing so the generated data were not so credible.
\\
After some research i've found the Ollama project and i've tried to use it for that purpose. Even if in that case there's no possibility for use a specific grammar for the output, i've obtaine a more credible output and in a more ldif compatiple syntax.
\\\\
At the end of all i've created the OCI image for the LDAP server with all the needed features.
\\\\
Now everyone can, using some commands, create a fake LDAP server with data in it generated automatically, so that an attacker could think to aim for a real one.
